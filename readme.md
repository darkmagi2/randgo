## Synopsis

This is a basic program in GO that grabs the input from a file (chars.txt) and then chooses a random line from that file and outputs it to a new file (output.txt). It's hacked together for now, just messing around with GO

## Motivation

I basically made this to randomly choose things for me, but also keep track of what has been chosen in the past.

## To-Do

Clean up the code, add some comments maybe.
Make it read the output file to do "something"

## Contributors

Just me
